notes:----------------------------

seed inventory and inventory are different
	* seed inventory has set slots
	* inventory has dynamic inventory

crafting seeds will produce different quality seed packets depending on crafting level

need to think of system to implement money. Possible ideas:
	* buying from daily market
		- fertilizer
		- plant seeds
	* selling to daily market
		- plants
	* upgrading farm visuals
		- plots
		- gui / hud
	* purchasing specific weather for plants

plants grow slower at night
sleeping to go to next day (button appears if night)
